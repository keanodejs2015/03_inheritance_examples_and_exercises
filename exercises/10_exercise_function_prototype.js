// Define a 'Robot' function constructor.
// Create two instances of Robot: 'robby' and 'cranky'.
// Both robby and cranky should respond to 'parts' and 'capabilities', these 
// should be empty arrays at first.


// Add 'core' to robby.parts, cranky.parts should still be empty.
// Add 'fly' to robby.capabilities, after doing that cranky.capabilities must 
// also have 'fly' without adding to it directly, so this property has to be 
// shared.

// Add 'Head' to robby.parts and cranky.parts

// Console.log parts and capabilities for both objects and see the result
