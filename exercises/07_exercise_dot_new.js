// Define an object called 'machine'.
// Define a method called 'new' in machine.
// When machine.new is called it should return 
// a new object with machine as its prototype. 
// e.g. var radio = machine.new();
// Machine should be the prototype of radio.

// when done, check if radio indeed has machine as its prototype.
